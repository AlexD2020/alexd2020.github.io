    <h1>Welcome to Alex's Programming Portfolio</h1>
        <h2> Hello everyone, welcome to my website! </h2>
        <p> I've created this website to learn how to code and program. This is the first website I've ever made myself so it's very bare bones right now. <br>
            Right now the Javascripts button up above will take you to projects I'm working on as I learn how to code while attending csc106 at URI. <br>
            Click on the about me button to learn a little bit more about myself. That is also where you can find out how to contact me through email. <br>
            As a beginner I'll probably make a few mistakes so please contact me if you spot one. I hope to eventually use this website as a showcase for <br>
            my current projects and achievements. A big thanks to the professor and TA's of the URI CSC106 class for all the help, guides, and knowledge. 
            </p>
