    <h1>About me</h1>
        
        <p> Hi my name is Alex. I was born in the smallest state Rhode Island. I've been here most my life except for a few years in Tennessee for work. <br>
            Work experience wise, my first job was as a buser down at one of the resturants on Federal Hill. After that I got a job in logistics, worked <br>
            with communcation devices, and I'm currently working at the Rhode Island Department of Health. I'm very lucky that my schedule allows me to <br>
            return to school and study the areas that interest me. I've always had a interest in computer science and I'm learning a lot of new things <br>
            attending csc106. Other areas of interest include gaming, reading, and watching movies. My current goals include buying a home and <br>
            obtaining a degree. If you spot any mistakes, please email me at fake-email@gmail.com. <br>
            <br>
